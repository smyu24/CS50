                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Seung-min and I am a 15 year old sophmore from Oregon, US. I started CS50 in the summer of my freshman year because I wanted to learn more about
                    the act of coding and how it operates. I have always been interested in coding and computers since I was a kid. When starting CS50, I didn't know a single
                    thing about coding or any languages. Since then I have taught myself several languages by using resources such as online courses, Youtube, and textbooks,
                    and dedicated myself to coding. Here are all the languages that I have amassed over time.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>C</strong> - First language I learned; They used this language in CS50 to explain how computers and memory work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Python</strong> - Second language I learned; Python can do nearly anything and everything, that C could do, but in a much easier way. (Not favorable to computing speed and efficiency)</li>
                        <li><strong>SQL</strong> - Third language I learned; SQL is a database language. It has the ability to manage databases by adding, removing, and applying changes to the database, SQL can also find information in a very efficient way.</li>
                        <li><strong>HTML</strong> - Fourth language I learned; HTML makes the basic structure of a website and is the barebones of a website.</li>
                        <li><strong>CSS</strong> - Fifth language I learned; CSS can, among many other things, give color and beauty to a website. This is the tool you use to sculpt the final touches and add fine details</li>
                    </ul><br>
